# GFXtract
A script-driven graphic converter/extractor/dumper.

## Current Functionality
Right now it just reads in a file and traces each line. This is just to get something up and basic script loading going.

## Things to add next
* Parsing scripts, identifying commands and parameters
* Executing simple commands (print, exit)
* If statements and loops
* Data types and variable creation
